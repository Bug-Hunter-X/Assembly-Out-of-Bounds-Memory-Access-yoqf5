mov eax, [ebx + 4*ecx]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as ebx + 4*ecx.  If ecx is a very large number, this can lead to an out-of-bounds memory access, potentially crashing the program or causing unpredictable behavior.  This is especially problematic if ecx is uninitialized or comes from an untrusted source.
