This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked bug in assembly language: out-of-bounds memory access.  The bug arises from the lack of explicit bounds checking when accessing an array using the instruction `mov eax, [ebx + 4*ecx]`. If `ecx` holds a value outside the bounds of the array, a crash or unpredictable behavior is the result.  The solution demonstrates how to add a check to prevent this issue.
